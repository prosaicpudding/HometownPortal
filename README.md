I have a way to add ad support, but we would all have to upgrade to ADT version 23 (most recent).
Let me know if that's okay with everyone. 
Also, will be modifying the manifest, main layout and main activity to do that. -Helen


Added a weather tab - Maria



Ideas on how to split up components:

1. Main activity + Misc things (splash screen, etc.)
2. Activities using google map (Food/Entertainment/Shopping/Schools)
3. Activities using feed lists (Employment/News)

We could have two people working on the map activities since they're a bit more complicated, one for the main activity, and one for the feeds.

Or we could split it up in a completely different fashion.

Feel free to massacre this file.
