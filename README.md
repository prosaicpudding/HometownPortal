Added a weather tab - Maria

Helen is currently working on finding and fixing the services not closing bug.
Files in use: all? I don't know where it is. If you need to work on something, message me.


Ideas on how to split up components:

1. Main activity + Misc things (splash screen, etc.)
2. Activities using google map (Food/Entertainment/Shopping/Schools)
3. Activities using feed lists (Employment/News)

We could have two people working on the map activities since they're a bit more complicated, one for the main activity, and one for the feeds.

Or we could split it up in a completely different fashion.

Feel free to massacre this file.
